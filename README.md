# WebDP100
A work-in-progress web-based driver (and maybe eventually GUI?) for the Alientek DP100 digital power supply, using [WebHID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebHID_API).

Just plug in the DP100 using the USB-A to USB-A cable (make sure it's in "USBD" mode; double-tap â—€ to switch), and click connect!

## Demo

Watch the [video](https://youtu.be/46w4E4JxKYE)

If you have a DP100, plug it in via USB, open Chrome and go to https://scottbez1.github.io/webdp100 to try this for yourself!

## About

Implementation of the HID protocol is based on reverse-engineering the Windows library (`ATK-DP100DLL(x64)_2.0.dll`), which can be found on baidu or in the [DP100-PyQt5-GUI](https://github.com/ElluIFX/DP100-PyQt5-GUI) project.

I don't plan on building a full-featured web interface, but if you want to, please feel free to use this as a starting point for your own project!

## Usage notes
### Linux
No drivers need to be installed, but the HID device may default to root-only permissions, resulting in "Failed to open the device" when you select it in the browser.

To adjust USB permissions, copy the `udev/rules.d/99-atk-dp100.rules` from this repo to the `/etc/udev/rules.d/` folder on your computer, then run `sudo udevadm control --reload-rules` and re-plug the USB cable.

## Acknowledgements
Shout out to @ElluIFX's [DP100-PyQt5-GUI](https://github.com/ElluIFX/DP100-PyQt5-GUI) project as a helpful reference and source of the DLL for reverse-engineering.
